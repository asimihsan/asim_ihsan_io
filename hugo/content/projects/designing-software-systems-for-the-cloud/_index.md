summary: |
  Existing AWS tutorials and books focus too much on AWS itself, glossing over details, and the console. This
  series focuses on the principles underlying software design for cloud-based systems. You will come away with
  a deeper understanding and a few end-to-end examples under your belt.
learning_objectives:
  - Design, implement, deploy, and operate AWS-based software systems.
  - Evaluate trade-offs between different managed services with respect to a given software architecture.
  - Reduce unknown unknowns when it comes to relying on managed services.
