I’m [Asim Ihsan](https://asim.ihsan.io). I've worked as a software engineer at
Amazon for six years, and in the software industry for twelve years. I’ve worked
on a variety of teams, such as AWS Lambda, AWS DynamoDB, and Amazon Go, on
software varying from distributed systems to systems that processed sensitive data
such as financial data for digital products and videos of people in Amazon Go.
Before Amazon I worked on embedded telecommunication softswitches at
MetaSwitch, and at Research in Motion.
