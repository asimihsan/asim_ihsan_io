title: About

I’m Asim Ihsan. I've worked as a software engineer at Amazon for six years, and in the software industry for
twelve years. I’ve worked on a variety of teams, such as AWS Lambda, AWS DynamoDB, and Amazon Go, on software
varying from distributed systems to systems that processed sensitive data such as financial data for digital
products and videos of people in Amazon Go. Before Amazon I worked on embedded telecommunication softswitches
at MetaSwitch, and at Research in Motion.

I like reading; fiction, non-fiction, research papers, all sorts. I'm constantly tinkering, experimenting, and
learning. [My antilibrary is massive](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/24/umberto-eco-antilibrary/).
