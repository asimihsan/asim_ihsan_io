## Introduction

- Briefly introduce deterministic encryption
- Describe the context of a user management system with unique email addresses
  and usernames
- Explain the goal of using deterministic encryption to protect email addresses
  while maintaining unique constraints

Deterministic encryption is a cryptographic technique where a given plaintext
always encrypts to the same ciphertext. This is useful when you want to compare
two encrypted values for equality without having to decrypt them first.

Consider a user management system where users have either a username, an email
address, or both to login with using a corresponding password. The system should
enforce unique constraints on both the username and email address fields. This
means that if a user with the username `alice` already exists, then a new user
with the username `alice` should not be allowed to be created. Similarly for
email addresses.

## How Deterministic Encryption Works

- Explain the concept of deterministic encryption and convergent encryption
- Describe how a site key and plaintext are used to generate a nonce for NaCL
  secretbox encryption
- Discuss its benefits for unique constraint management using hash keys in
  databases like DynamoDB

## Security Evaluation & Threat Model

- Establish a threat model, considering database leaks but a lower likelihood of
  site key leaks
- Assess the security implications in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and
  availability (CIA)
- Analyze mitigated and unmitigated threats using the STRIDE acronym framework

## Comparing Deterministic Encryption with Other Approaches

- Discuss how deterministic encryption differs from encryption-at-rest
- Explain how deterministic encryption solves similar problems to convergent
  encryption
- Clarify non-goals and limitations of deterministic encryption in the proposed
  system

## Best Practices and Tips for Implementing Deterministic Encryption

- Secure key management using services like AWS Secrets Manager
- Monitor access control and implement strong authentication and authorization
  mechanisms
- Regularly perform security audits and vulnerability assessments
- Maintain a holistic security strategy with layered defenses

## Conclusion

- Summarize the benefits of using deterministic encryption in user management
  systems
- Emphasize the importance of a comprehensive security approach that extends
  beyond encryption techniques
